# This is the official list of people who can contribute (and typically have
# contributed) code to the UUV Simulator repository.  The AUTHORS file lists
# the copyright holders; this file lists people.  For example, Robert Bosch
# GmbH's employees are listed here but not in AUTHORS, because Robert Bosch
# GmbH holds the copyright.
#
# Often employers or academic institution claim ownership over code that is
# written in certain circumstances, so please do due diligence to ensure that
# you have the right to submit the code.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file, either J's name or J's
# organization's name should be added to the AUTHORS file, depending on
# whether J's employer (or academic institution) claims ownership over code
# that is written for this project.
#
# How to add names to this file: Individual's name <submission email address>.
# Use corporate email address if Individual's organization is copyright holder
# of her contributions.
#
# Please keep the list sorted.
